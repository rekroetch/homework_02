# My Portfolio

## About
A personal webpage with three easily navigated pages. The 'About Me' page features a brand statement, image, and contact information.  The 'Portfolio' page features several highlighted web applications, each including an image, brief explanation with tool used, and links to the deployed site as well as the GitHub repo.  The 'Contact' page, though not yet functional, will allow visitors to my site to leave messages for me.  The site also includes a functional navbar, screen size responsiveness, and a footer containing links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and a pdf of my resume.
